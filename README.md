# The Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is based on an American television game show and named after its host, Monty Hall. The problem goes like this:

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.

You pick a door, say number one. Then the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say nuymber three, which reveals a goat. 

The host then says to you, "Do you want to keep your original foor, or switch to door number two?"

Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
